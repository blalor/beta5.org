* VIN: `VBKUN6407PM850211`
* 9800 miles
* 105hp parallel twin
* Six-speed gearbox
* Recently serviced
* ~1,000 miles on Shinko 705 tires

This 2023 Husqvarna Norden 901 is in excellent condition, (almost) spotlessly clean, has been recently serviced, and is ready for its next adventure.  I've added about 6,500 miles since purchasing it from the first owner in December 2023.  It's remained mostly stock, and has been trouble-free. It's really a delight to ride, I've just decided I wanted something a bit more road-focused for longer trips.  It's seen minimal off-pavement miles in my ownership, and has never been dropped at speed, but has had a couple of zero-speed tip-overs; there are no signs of damage.  This is an extremely clean bike.

I have a clean Virginia title in my name.

Asking $9,800.

## OEM options

These OEM items were added by myself and the previous owner. 

* Explorer Pack
* "Ride Husqvarna" Bluetooth integration
* OEM tire pressure monitoring system
* Heated rider and passenger seats
* Heated grips

The Explorer Pack allows access to the Explorer ride mode, which allows adjusting the traction control, throttle map, and ABS independently of ride mode, as well as remembering ABS settings when turning the bike off.  The Bluetooth integration is pretty meh, but you can control your phone's audio playback and answer calls using the left switch pad.  The TPMS is fantastic for keeping an eye on tire pressure while riding.  And if you're spoiled and soft like me, the heated seats and grips are nice, even just on cool mornings.

## Aftermarket items

* Vanasche Adventure Footpegs
* Vanasche Case Saver
* Rottweiler clear dash protection
* AXP skid plate
* WRS short windscreen

The footpegs are wider and lower than the factory ones and I have purchased them for several bikes.

The case saver is really just a bling-y sprocket cover.  Vanasche makes nice shit, tho.

The skid plate was added by the previous owner; it's made of HDPE and provides excellent coverage of the tank and bottom of the engine, without adding much weight or reflecting noise at the rider.

My biggest complaint about this bike has been the wind protection. My favorite is the WRS short windscreen that's installed currently (and shown in the photos).  It doesn't generate a lot of buffeting and keeps the wind mostly off my chest.  The others that are included may be preferable to you depending on your sensitivity to noise and sense of aesthetics.

## Included but not installed

* Camel ADV 1-finger clutch kit
* Vanasche GPS mounting bracket
* Cat-less mid-pipe
* OEM windscreen
* OEM Explorer windscreen, shortened
* WRS touring windscreen
* Outback Motortek rear luggage rack
* Outback Motortek side luggage racks
* Shinko E-804 (front) tire, ~700mi
* Shinko E-806 (rear) tire, ~3,000mi

The 1-finger clutch kit is a popular mod, lessening the effort needed to pull the clutch lever in, but I found it made it *too* easy to pull the clutch, and I just preferred the stock lever feel.  

I took the GPS bracket off because I'm not including a GPS and it looks dorky with nothing mounted.  Two screws to mount it.

Some people complain about the catalytic converter being a source of heat.  The previous owner had this no-name mid-pipe installed in place of the cat. I found it obnoxiously loud, without making much of a difference in heat.  I put the cat back on.

The Outback Motortek bits were included by the previous owner, but I had a different set I preferred.  I believe the rear rack is missing some spacers needed to make it fit correctly.  The pannier racks are complete and mount perfectly.  These would be great for Mosko Moto or Enduristan soft bags, and are pretty universal for other types of hard and soft bags.

I moved to the Shinko 705 tires from the 804/805 I had installed previously; the 705 is a bit more road-oriented.  Plenty of life left in the knobbies, and I'll mount them for you if you'd like.
